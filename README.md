This project looks into the practicalities of Trees, MLPs and Entity Embedding.

The homework is divided into four main parts: 
1. Data-preprocessing 
2. Developing different models and evaulating the models - without Entity Embeddings 
3. Pass on the entity embeddings from Neural Network model to other models and evaluate the models 
4. Compare the models
